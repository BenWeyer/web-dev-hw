# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Benjamin Weyer
I decided to take MART341 in order to improve my limited coding and web design skillset. As an employee for a small local  business, I understand the importance of a digital platform in the 21st century and want to enhance my knowledge with the intention of helping our company grow.

-The internet is comprised of a large number of independent networks that ensure connectivity between devices. This interconnectivity allows the sharing of ideas and information between any device in the world.

-The internet is not a digital cloud but in fact a physical wiring system that spans and connects the globe.

-The internet connects participants while the web connects information.
