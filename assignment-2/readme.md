# Version Control Systems

- Version Control Systems not only allow web developers to make changes in a
file but also permits them to track those changes over time. Version Control
also allows developers to easily retrace to a previous versions of a document.
Version Control is advantageous in our class because it promotes student
collaboration and transparency when changes are made to a file.

- This week, we familiarized ourselves with creating and connecting to
repositories on GitHub. We learned the necessary steps to move changes
from Atom into the GitHub Desktop and eventually push those changes from the
applications to GitHub.com where our peers can view our work and alterations
made through the process.
I ran into a number of problems this week, but the hardest and most time
consuming issue arose after I found my work from Part 1 had somehow been cleared
from my GitHub app. I was unable to troubleshoot how to import a local folder
into the Desktop and was actually forced to create new folders and files
within the GitHub website without the convenience of publishing from the app.
Luckily for Part 2 I discovered how to import local files and folders which
has made the process considerably easier.
