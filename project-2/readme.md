# Project 2 Technical Report

1. I am thrilled with the progress I have made with my skillset in HTML during the last serveral weeks! I feel far more confident today than I did months ago but realize there is still so much to learn to improve my overall capablities as a coder in HTML. I want to continue playing around with different formatting options and still do not feel completely comfortable with linking and setting up structure within HTML.

2. I am actually fairly unaware of the differences between HTML and CSS. I am interested in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of both!

3. During Project 2, we used our previous knowledge about HTML to create an instructable webpage. The page included several images, links to additional pages, and differing styles we have learned during the HTML portion of this class. This week we included navigation elements in our HTML coding that we had not previously utilized.
