    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Ben Weyer. I was born and raised in Bozeman, moved to Missoula in 2012 to pursue an academic and athletic career at the University of Montana, and am currently in the process of moving back to the Gallatin Valley.</p>
      <p>I chose this project because I work in the coffee industry. My family owns and operates a small coffee company in Bozeman, Montana called Yellowstone Coffee Roasters. After several years spent away from the family business, I am transitioning back into the coffee world. My role in the company is to discover, buy, and develop some of the finest coffees from around the world.</p>
      <p>If you care to learn more about the company or the coffee industry, please feel free to check out our <a href="https://yellowstonecoffee.com/">website</a>. <a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/">Stumptown Coffee</a> is also a great resource to learn about additional brewing methods!</p>
