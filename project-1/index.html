  <h2>Your Feet</h2>

  <h3>Pablo Neruda</h3>

<hr>
<p>
  When I cannot look at your face <br />
  I look at your feet.
</p>

<p>
  Your feet of arched bone, <br />
  your hard little feet.
</p>

<p>
  I know that they support you, <br />
  and that your gente weight <br />
  rises upon them.
</p>

<p>
  Your waist and your breasts, <br />
  the doubled purple <br />
  of your nipples, <br />
  the sockets of your eyes <br />
  that have just flown away, <br />
  your wide fruit mouth <br />
  your red tresses, <br />
  my little tower.
</p>

<p>
  But I love your feet <br />
  only because they walked <br />
  upon the earth and upon <br />
  the wind and upon the waters, <br />
  until they found me.
</p>
