# Assignment 5 Technical Report

1. While browsing through popular styles of the 1990's I found that the bright colors that dominated the previous decades remained very popular. The style of my page reflects the decade in the use of vibrant colors and the simple fonts that dominated the early stages of the internet.

2. The color palatte can be specified three separate ways in css: name, RGB, and Hex Values. In this assignment I used the following three colors:
  - Orange, rgb(255,165,0), #FFA500
  - Light Pink, rgb(255,182,193), #FFB6C1
  - Purple, rgb(128,0,128), #800080

We linked HTML pages to CSS selectors and played around with simple techniques you can implement to add your own distinct style to a web page. For the most part, the introduction to CSS seemed fairly straightforward, but there were a few elements I did struggle with. One styling element I was unable to change was the font-size element in the separate containers of my HTML. I tried several different coding variations, but I was never able to change the font-size which ultimately resulted in what I believed to be a boring web page.
