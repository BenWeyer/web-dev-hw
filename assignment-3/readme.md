# Assignment 3 Technical Report

- A web page contains only *one* main head and body element. Within a head element creators add metadata that is not visible on your page but tells browsers and processors valuable information about your HTML. The body element makes up the data that is physically displayed on your site.
-  The structural markup embodies the basic structure and set up of your page. This includes elements such as headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. The semantic markup helps place emphasis on certain words, phrases, and paragraphs. This includes (but is not limited to) elements such bold, italicized, and underlined words.
- This week we continued our work in HTML documents. We became more familiar with head elements, structural markups, semantic markups, and the structure of internal and external hyperlinks. This week I felt more comfortable and worked far more efficiently than I did during Project 1. For the first time during this course I did not encounter any difficulties that took significant time to troubleshoot!
